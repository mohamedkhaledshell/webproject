<h3>What is Computer Science Really?</h3>

<h4>In theory what is it?</h4>

<p>General understanding of hardware design/components of a computer.  Specific (current) knowledge of programming languages, operating systems, 
internet technology/protocol, software engineering principles, databases, data structures and algorithms, current software design principles.
Being curious enought to not only study the why and the how behind how programs work in computers, cars, refrigerators, etc but take 
that information and write your own programs. Computer Science is the study of computers and computational systems. Unlike electrical and computer engineers, computer scientists deal mostly with software and software systems; this includes their theory, design, development, and application.
Principal areas of study within Computer Science include artificial intelligence, computer systems and networks,
security, database systems, human computer interaction, vision and graphics, numerical analysis, programming languages, software engineering, 
bioinformatics and theory of computing.
Although knowing how to program is essential to the study of computer science, 
it is only one element of the field. Computer scientists design and analyze algorithms to 
solve programs and study the performance of computer hardware and software. The problems that 
computer scientists encounter range from the abstract determining what problems can be solved with computers and the complexity
 of the algorithms that solve them designing applications that perform well on handheld devices, that are easy to use, 
 and that uphold security measures.</p>

<h4>What Can You Do With a Computer Science Major</h4>

<p>

Think about the things you do every day: posting status updates, downloading songs, checking your class schedule online . . .
Do you think it would be cool to design the technologies that make those devices work better? To invent new ones? 
To help make the lives and jobs of people easier? Then maybe computer science is the right path for you!
But first, let us set some things straight. Computer scientists are not the people you call 
when your printer stops working. And they do not sit in dark cubicles all day without talking to anyone.
Whatever you think computer science is, you are wrong, says Dianna Xu, chair of the computer 
science department at Bryn Mawr College in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania.
So . . . what is it?

Computer scientists use technology to solve problems. They write software to make 
computers do new things or accomplish tasks more efficiently. They create applications for mobile devices, develop websites,
and program software. And you can find them everywhere, from big tech firms and government agencies to startups and nonprofits.
It is more than everyday computing, says Liz Burd, Pro-Vice Chancellor in Learning and Teaching at the University of Newcastle in Australia. 
It is building the tools that enable everyday computing.
One of the biggest things computer science majors learn is how to logically 
think through a problem and find a way to solve it. Chris Stephenson, Executive Director of the Computer Science Teachers 
Association, adds that good computer scientists also understand teamwork and are good communicators. They work with other people all the time,
she says, including those who do not come from a CS background. No matter how brilliant you are, at some point you will have to explain to 
someone how your product works or what your code does, Stephenson says.</p>


<h4>What Can You Do With a Computer Science Degree?</h4>

<p>While you are considering earning a computer science degree, you are probably
 curious about what your options will be after graduation. You have got bills 
 to pay and children to raise, so you are seeking  a career that is a safe bet.
When it comes to the future, there are few guarantees. 
But you are not likely to find a career path with a more optimistic outlook than 
computer science careers. With job opportunities increasing significantly and above average 
starting salaries that escalate with experience, it is no wonder youâ€™re considering this field.  
We know, we know you have not made your decision yet. 
But as you explore your options, it is always helpful to know as much as possible about the types 
of jobs that will be available to you once you earn your degree. To help you in your research, we analyzed
more than 560,000 job postings over the past year to determine the most common positions for computer science degree holders. 
So, what can you do with a computer science degree? Take a look!
