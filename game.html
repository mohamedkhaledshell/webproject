<h1>Games developer</h1>
 <iframe width="853" height="480" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uPzqhBkZP_4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
 <p>
 Games developers are involved in the creation and production of games for personal computers, games consoles, social/online games, arcade games, tablets, mobile phones and other hand held devices. Their work involves either design (including art and animation) or programming.
<br/>
<br/>
Games development is a fast-moving, multi-billion pound industry. The making of a game from concept to finished product can take up to three years and involve teams of up to 200 professionals.
<br/>
<br/>
There are many stages, including creating and designing a game's look and how it plays, animating characters and objects, creating audio, programming, localisation, testing and producing.
<br/>
<br/>
The games developer job title covers a broad area of work and there are many specialisms within the industry. These include:
<ul>
<li>quality assurance tester;</li>
<li>programmer, with various specialisms such as network, engine, toolchain and artificial intelligence;</li>
<li>audio engineer;</li>
<li>artist, including concept artist, animator and 3D modeller;</li>
<li>producer;</li>
<li>editor;</li>
<li>designer;</li>
<li>special effects technician.</li>
</ul>

 </p>
 
 <h1>Responsibilities</h1>
 <p>
 Responsibilities vary depending on your specialist area but may include:
 
 <ul>
 <li>developing designs and/or initial concept designs for games including game play;</li>
 <li>generating game scripts and storyboards;</li>
 <li>creating the visual aspects of the game at the concept stage;</li>
 <li>using 2D or 3D modelling and animation software, such as Maya, at the production stage;</li>
 <li>producing the audio features of the game, such as the character voices, music and sound effects;</li>
 <li>programming the game using programming languages such as C++;</li>
 <li>quality testing games in a systematic and thorough way to find problems or bugs and recording precisely where the problem was discovered;</li>
 <li>solving complex technical problems that occur within the game's production;</li>
 <li>disseminating knowledge to colleagues, clients, publishers and gamers;</li>
 <li>understanding complex written information, ideas and instructions;</li>
 <li>working closely with team members to meet the needs of a project;</li>
 <li>planning resources and managing both the team and the process;</li>
 <li>performing effectively under pressure and meeting deadlines to ensure the game is completed on time.</li>

 </ul>
 </p>
 <h1>Salary</h1>
 <p>
 <ul>
 <li>Typical starting salaries for artists/animators and programmers may be around £18,000 to £25,000. Entry-level roles, such as quality assurance tester, may attract a lower salary.</li>
 <li>Range of typical salaries at senior level with 3-5 years' experience: £35,000 to 45,000. At the higher end of the scale, technical directors, developers, producers and team managers can earn up to £70,000 and beyond.</li>
 </ul>
 Salaries vary depending on the specialism, as well as the company type, size and location of the employer. Some companies offer their employees bonuses or a profit-sharing scheme.
<br/>
<br/>
Income figures are intended as a guide only.
 </p>
 <h1>Working hours</h1>
 <p>
 Working hours are usually flexible, with many developers starting later than 9am. However, 
 working hours are generally long and developers often work a 40-hour week or more. 
 In order to try to meet games completion deadlines, games development teams may need to work a 60 to 80-hour week, 
 including work over the weekends.
 </p>
 <h1>What to expect</h1>
 <p>
 <ul>
 <li>The role is typically office, studio or production house based, although there are some freelancers working from home.</li>
 <li>Developers tend to work in a team environment in order to meet the complex nature of contemporary games.
 It is not uncommon for groups and individual team members to be located remotely, both in the UK and other parts of the world.</li>
 <li>Women make up only 14% of employees in the games industry (Skillset, 2012).</li>
 <li>Currently, just 4.7% of employees in the games industry are from ethnic minority groups (Skillset, 2012).</li>
 <li>The largest concentration of the games development workforce is found in the Midlands, with a large number in Scotland and London as well (Creative Skillset, 2012).</li>
 <li>The working environment for games developers is often informal and the dress code is usually casual, although this may depend on the amount of client contact.</li>
 <li>Extensive hours spent using a mouse and monitor may have health implications, with some potential risk of back problems, eye strain and repetitive strain injury in the wrist and hand.</li>
 <li>Depending on your specialist area, some overseas travel is possible, although many multinational games companies have their</li>
 <li>European headquarters in the UK. Occasional travel, including international travel, may be required in order to meet clients, attend training courses or carry out research.</li>

 </ul>
 </p>
 
<h1> Qualifications</h1>
<p>
Although this role is open to graduates in all subject areas, a relevant degree, HND or foundation degree in one of the following subjects may increase your chances:
<ul>
<li>computer games development;</li>
<li>computer games design;</li>
<li>multimedia design;</li>
<li>interactive media;</li>
<li>software engineering;</li>
<li>mathematics;</li>
<li>physics;</li>
<li>animation;</li>
<li>graphic design;</li>
<li>computer science.</li>
</ul>
Entry without a degree, HND or foundation degree is sometimes possible with relevant experience, although most people who work in games are graduates.
<br/>
<br/>
An alternative entry route into games development is as a quality assurance technician or tester. Although you do not need to have an HND or degree to enter at this level, some programming experience is desirable, as well as extensive experience of game playing, an understanding of different styles, and platforms and database skills.
<br/>
<br/>
A relevant postgraduate qualification, while not essential, may be useful, especially if your first degree or HND does not involve a games specialism element. Several universities offer Masters degrees in games-related specialisms.
<br/>
<br/>
With the increasing popularity of games and advances in technology, the industry offers a wide range of opportunities, but competition is intense at all levels and games developers need to demonstrate a high level of commitment and achievement.
</p>
<h1>Skills</h1>
<p>
You will need to show:
<ul>

<li>technical ability, in particular familiarisation with a range of software packages and/or programming languages;</li>
<li>teamworking skills;</li>
<li>ability to work independently;</li>
<li>creativity;</li>
<li>communication skills;</li>
<li>problem-solving ability;</li>
<li>flexibility;</li>
<li>self-motivation;</li>
<li>initiative;</li>
<li>enthusiasm;</li>
<li>ability to meet deadlines and client requirements.</li>
</ul>
A strong interest in games and knowledge of the industry is also vital. Get involved in online forums to increase your knowledge of current industry hot topics and read relevant games development magazines, such as Gamasutra and 3D World.
<br/>
<br/>
It is widely predicted in the industry that games will become even closer to film in terms of technological advances. Because of this, skills in cinematography or story writing are likely to be welcomed within the games development role.
<br/>
<br/>
As games are sold internationally, developers also need to have a good level of cultural awareness so that games are appropriate to their markets.
<br/>
<br/>
Online and mobile platforms look set to drive technological developments in the market and become strong competitors to the more traditional gaming sectors.
</p>

<h1>Work experience</h1>
<p>
It is essential that you create a portfolio (for artistic roles) or working demo (for programming roles) with examples of work you have created. This gives employers a good idea of your talent and creativity. The ability to code in C++, scripting experience and knowledge of specific software tools are also useful skills.
<br/>
<br/>
Relevant work experience gained, for example, through an industrial placement during your degree, is also valuable.
</p>

<h1>Employers</h1>
<p>
There are approximately 5,500 people employed in the computer game industry in the UK (Skillset, 2012). The UK is the fourth largest games-producing country in the world after the USA, Japan and Canada. The industry is also strong in Europe.
<br/>
<br/>
The number of freelance games developers has risen to 14%, from 3% in 2009.
<br/>
<br/>
Employers are largely games developers or games publishers. Development studios may be owned by a publisher or may be independent (known as indies) and they may do business internationally, nationally or regionally.
<br/>
<br/>
Games production companies and studios vary in size from small companies employing fewer than five people to multinational studios employing hundreds.
<br/>
<br/>
As well as games for PCs, consoles or handheld gaming devices, games are created in a variety of different forms and can be commissioned by such diverse clients as:
<ul>

<li>educational institutions;</li>
<li>broadcasters;</li>
<li>DVD and CD-ROM authoring companies;</li>
<li>information providers such as local and national government;</li>
<li>Internet Service Providers (ISPs);</li>
<li>marketing and advertising agencies;</li>
<li>mobile phone companies;</li>
<li>design companies.</li>
</ul>
Project work accounts for a considerable proportion of employment in this field. For many games projects, developers work in teams and projects can often last for substantial periods of time - taking up to three years to complete.

<h1>Professional development</h1>
<p>
Games developers often begin at a junior level and are managed by a more experienced lead developer, who will give training on the job.
<br/>
<br/>
The games development industry is fast-moving, with changing technology, software packages and working methods, so an ability to manage your own learning and keep up to date with technological developments is essential.
<br/>
<br/>
Quality assurance testers within games development can take the BCS Professional Certification in Software Testing at Foundation, Intermediate, Practitioner or Higher level to increase their knowledge and employability. The BCS (The Chartered Institute for IT) also provides a range of accredited courses for IT professionals.
<br/>
<br/>
Continuing professional development (CPD) in the sector and the development of graduate IT professionals during the early years of their career are promoted and supported by Tech Partnership.
<br/>
<br/>
A range of relevant courses, for example in 3D modelling and animation, for those entering the design side of games development are advertised on Creative Skillset. These courses range from short training courses to Masters degrees.
<br/>
<br/>
Games developers are expected to acquire confidence in new technical skills as part of their job and some companies develop their own software, specific to their needs. Much of the training is done in-house and on the job.
</p>
	
<h1>Career prospects</h1>
<p>
A common entry route into games development is to begin as a quality assurance tester. Testers can then progress to a lead tester role within a few years and then potentially move on to the design or production side or into management.
<br/>
<br/>
Entry is also possible straight into programming and artist roles, although previous experience is preferred.
<br/>
<br/>
Career progression within games development is relatively fast. Many who enter the industry at junior level end up at lead level within five to seven years and can reach senior level within their first ten years.
<br/>
<br/>
Senior-level positions include technical directors, developers, producers and team managers. Higher level and specialist programming skills are increasingly in short supply and this is currently an area in which career development can be particularly fast.
<br/>
<br/>
There are also opportunities to develop your career overseas. Games development jobs can be found in several other countries including Japan, the USA, Canada, Germany, France and Scandinavia.
<br/>
<br/>
Freelance work is possible and, with experience, some games developers choose to build up their own business and set up their own development studio or similar.
<br/>
<br/>
Recent significant developments in the industry include the growth in the use of the internet and online multiplayer gaming. Most games now have an online component whereby players can compete with others across the world.
<br/>
<br/>
In addition, smartphones and handheld games devices have led to developments in wireless platforms and interactive game applications. As a result, there are opportunities to move into these newer areas of games development.
